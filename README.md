# Sketch Speech

WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository is just a snapshot of some functionality from the Kiosk system (QRG Lab research project) that I worked on to help develop a multimodal interactive experience with our the lab's system CogSketch. CogSketch already allows for the modality of sketching (informal drawing) so this project laid the groundwork for adding speech as another form of interactions. The current system only allowed labeling of glyphs, but with the use of Microsoft's /PSI platform for integrating these modalities and KQML (a standard form of communication our lab's software uses), the system is much more extensible and should be able to start enabling more complex interactions than just glyph labeling.

This code needs several other systems to run, all of which are part of ongoing research in the QRG lab and as such I will not be able to upload them.
